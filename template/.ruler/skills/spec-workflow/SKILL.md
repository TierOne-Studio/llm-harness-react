description: Use BEFORE implementing any behavioral code change (new feature, improvement, bug fix, refactor that changes behavior, behavioral change, requirement-correction, follow-up) — a Markdown SPEC under docs/specs/ MUST be created or updated, and clarifying questions asked, BEFORE writing code; and reconciled with what shipped AFTER. Governs the docs/specs/ folder, SPEC naming, the SPEC template, create-vs-update rules, the requirements clarification gate, the pre/post workflow, and code↔doc sync. The spec-steward agent is the writer; this skill is the procedure. NOT for non-code, type-only, or config-with-no-behavior changes (state the waiver phrase). Pairs with documentation-and-adrs (ADRs), plan-mode, tdd-workflow, acceptance-verifier, cross-repo-workspace.

# Spec Workflow

Documentation is part of the implementation, not an extra. Every **behavioral** code change
begins by creating/updating a Markdown SPEC and ends by reconciling it with what shipped.
The **`spec-steward`** agent is the single writer of `docs/specs/**`; this skill is the procedure
it and the main agent follow. If your project records the load-bearing rationale behind this
workflow as an ADR, cite it (per `documentation-and-adrs`) — a SPEC **cites** ADRs, it never
restates their rationale.

## Bootstrap (first use in a fresh project)

This skill is **self-contained**: it carries the `docs/specs/` scaffolding inline (Appendices A & B).
On the first behavioral change in a project that has no `docs/specs/` yet, `spec-steward`:

1. Creates `docs/specs/README.md` — the index (from **Appendix B**).
2. Creates `docs/specs/_template.md` — the SPEC template (from **Appendix A**).
3. Writes the first `SPEC-001-<short-kebab>.md` from that template and adds it to the index.

No external files are required — a scaffolded project gets the full workflow from this skill.

## Where specs live (per-repo, split by layer)

- A **UI** repo holds **`ui`** specs: screens, flows, forms, client validation, UX.
- An **API / backend** repo holds **`contract`** specs: entities, endpoints, DTOs, RBAC, migrations.
- A cross-cutting feature has **one spec per layer**, cross-linked via the `counterpart_spec`
  frontmatter field (`"<other-repo>#SPEC-NNN"`), bound by a coordination doc. See `cross-repo-workspace`.
  One spec per (feature × layer) — never two for the same layer.
- A **single-repo** project sets `counterpart_spec: "standalone"`.

## Naming & location

- `docs/specs/SPEC-NNN-<short-kebab>.md` (sequential, zero-padded, never reused).
- `docs/specs/PRD-NNN-<short-kebab>.md` only for an epic spanning ≥2 SPECs.
- Template: `docs/specs/_template.md`. Index: `docs/specs/README.md`.
- Change Log is an **embedded section** in each SPEC (append-only) — not a separate file.
- A SPEC **cites** ADRs; it never restates rationale (per `documentation-and-adrs`).

## Does this change need a SPEC?

YES for any change with **observable behavior**: feature, improvement, bug fix, behavioral
change, requirement-correction, follow-up, or a refactor that changes behavior.

The ONLY exemptions (state the exact phrase, mirroring `tdd-workflow` waivers):

```
SPEC waived — non-code change.
SPEC waived — type-only.
SPEC waived — config change with no behavior impact.
```

"small change", "obvious fix", "trivial", "just a refactor" are **NEVER** valid skips. A pure
no-behavior refactor needs no new SPEC, but if one exists for that feature, add a Change Log note.

## PRE-coding workflow (before any implementation or test code)

1. **Classify** the request; decide if it is behavioral (above). If exempt, state the waiver and stop here.
2. **Search** `docs/specs/README.md` + grep `docs/specs/` for a SPEC governing this feature/files. (Anti-duplicate.)
3. **Resolve ambiguity — the clarification gate.** Scan for underspecification across: goal,
   target user/role, scope, behavior (happy path + edge/error cases), data model
   (cardinality/nullability/validation), RBAC, acceptance criteria, affected surfaces, UX states.
   **Verify what the codebase already answers first**, then for each remaining dimension decide
   Known / Assumable-safe / **Must-ask**. If any Must-ask remains, the steward returns
   `NEEDS-INPUT` and the main agent **asks the user** (batched, ≤4, options where possible).
   **Do NOT write the SPEC or any code until material ambiguity is resolved.** Never ask what
   you can verify in the code; never guess past a material ambiguity.
4. **Decide create vs update** — if a SPEC already covers this feature, UPDATE it; never open a second.
5. **Create/update the SPEC** (via `spec-steward`) from `_template.md`. It must pass the
   readiness rubric before leaving `Draft`: goal + target user; in- and out-of-scope; every AC
   falsifiable + mapped to a planned test; data model fully typed; RBAC stated; every named
   edge/error case has defined behavior; **no `TBD`/placeholder in a load-bearing section**.
6. **Load-bearing check** — if the change makes a decision that would force updating 3+
   skills/docs/files, also write/cite an **ADR** (`documentation-and-adrs`).
7. **Architect review** — when the plan touches 3+ files OR auth/sessions/RBAC/route-guards/
   state-mgmt-rewrites/data-migration, route the SPEC through `architect-reviewer`
   (`APPROVE_PLAN`/`REVISE_PLAN`/`BLOCK`). Revise the SPEC on REVISE/BLOCK; no code until `APPROVE_PLAN`.
   Cross-repo: the architect reviews BOTH specs + the coordination doc together.
8. **Present** the SPEC (or its diff) + the architect verdict + the plan, then STOP for approval.

## DURING coding

If you discover the SPEC was wrong, incomplete, or based on a bad assumption, **STOP, fix the
SPEC first** (update assumptions + Change Log), then resume. Code must never silently diverge from the SPEC.

## POST-coding workflow (before declaring done / opening a PR)

Delegate to `spec-steward` (it edits `docs/specs/**`):

1. **Reconcile** — *Affected areas* matches the real diff; ACs updated if behavior changed; each AC linked to its now-green test (file:line).
2. **Assumptions** — mark each `Confirmed` or `Corrected` (strike + replace wrong ones). A `Confirmed` assumption the code contradicts is a `BLOCK`, not a silent rewrite.
3. **Change Log** — append `YYYY-MM-DD · PR #NN · <what> · <why>` (note corrected assumptions).
4. **Memory** — if an original assumption was wrong, the main agent also writes a `feedback` memory entry (P7).
5. **Status** — `Draft` → `Implemented`.
6. **Review chain** — `code-reviewer` + `qa-validator` (+ `security-reviewer` if applicable) + `spec-steward` + `acceptance-verifier`. The steward's `BLOCK` and `acceptance-verifier`'s `BLOCK` are binding on "done."
7. If the project has the deterministic gate (below), CI `spec-gate` must be green; for cross-repo, the `counterpart_spec` links must resolve.

## Definition of done (spec dimension; extends P8.0)

A behavioral change is not done until: a governing SPEC was created/updated this change and is
`Implemented`; every AC maps to an executed-green test; no assumption is `Unconfirmed` or
contradicted; the Change Log has this change's entry; Affected areas matches the diff; the SPEC
passed the readiness rubric with no unresolved Must-ask ambiguity; `spec-steward` returned
non-`BLOCK`. When P4 triggered, `architect-reviewer` returned `APPROVE_PLAN`.

## Deterministic gates (optional per-project add-on)

The agents make the workflow *easy* to follow; deterministic CI scripts make it *enforced*. These
scripts live **outside `.ruler/`**, so a harness-scaffolded project starts with the **soft** workflow
(this skill + `spec-steward` + `acceptance-verifier` + human PR review). To upgrade it to a **hard
gate**, add to the project (recommended once the team relies on the workflow):

- **`spec-gate`** — a behavioral `src/**` change must ship with a `docs/specs/**` change, OR a
  `[skip-spec: type-only|config-no-behavior|non-code]` waiver token in the commit/PR body.
  ("small" / "obvious" / "trivial" are NEVER valid skips.)
- **completeness lint** — no placeholder/empty required section in a SPEC.
- **cross-link lint** — `counterpart_spec` / `related_specs` resolve.

Wire these as a `pull_request` CI job. Until then, `spec-steward`'s `BLOCK` + mandatory human PR
review are the enforcement.

# SPEC-NNN: <Human Title>

## 1. Summary (intended behavior)

One paragraph: what the system should do after this change, from the user's perspective.

## 2. Context & problem

Why this change exists — the need/incident/request that prompted it. What's wrong or
missing today. Cite files where the constraint is visible.

## 3. Scope

**In scope:** <bullets>

**Out of scope / non-goals:** <bullets — explicit, so reviewers don't expect them>

## 4. Assumptions

Numbered; each gets a status. Wrong ones are struck and corrected in place.

1. [Confirmed|Unconfirmed|Corrected] <assumption>
2. ...

> Correct any Unconfirmed assumption now, or implementation proceeds on it.

## 5. Affected areas

Files / modules / routes / RBAC scopes / API contracts / schema. Keep aligned with the real diff.

- `src/features/<Feature>/...`
- Routes / guards: ...
- API endpoints consumed: ...

## 6. Acceptance criteria (falsifiable; each maps to a test)

| # | Criterion (observable behavior) | Proving test (file:line) |
|---|---|---|
| AC1 | <e.g. "Returns 403 when user is in a different org"> | <unit/e2e path> |
| AC2 | ... | ... |

## 7. Implementation plan

3–8 steps (mirrors plan-mode). Each: `files:` / `tests:` / `risk:` / `slice:`.

## 8. Testing plan

Which layer proves which AC — unit/component (e.g. Vitest + Testing Library), e2e (e.g. Playwright in `e2e/<module>/`).
Name the test files.

## 9. Risks & failure modes

Null/empty/large/race/partial/network/malformed/boundary as relevant; mitigation per risk.

## 10. Open questions

Unresolved items blocking or shaping the work.

## Change Log

Append-only. Newest first.

# Feature Specifications (SPECs)

Durable *what + how* for this project's features and behavioral changes. A SPEC is the
**source of truth for intended behavior**: created/updated **before** code and reconciled
with what shipped **after**. The `spec-steward` agent owns this folder; the `spec-workflow`
skill carries the full procedure.

**Layer:** a UI repo holds **`ui`** specs (screens, flows, forms, client validation, UX); an
API/backend repo holds **`contract`** specs (entities, endpoints, DTOs, RBAC, migrations). A
cross-cutting feature has one spec per layer, cross-linked via the `counterpart_spec`
frontmatter field. Single-repo projects use `counterpart_spec: "standalone"`. See `cross-repo-workspace`.

**SPEC vs ADR vs plan:** a SPEC is *what we build + how* (this folder). An **ADR**
(`docs/decisions/`) is *why a load-bearing decision was made*; SPECs cite ADRs, they do not
restate rationale. `plan-mode` is ephemeral execution sequencing, persisted *into* the SPEC.

## Index

| # | Title | Status | Updated | Feature paths |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| _none yet_ | | | | |

## Status lifecycle

`Draft` → (`Approved`) → `Implemented` → `Superseded by SPEC-XXX`

- `Draft` — written before code, under review.
- `Approved` — signed off but implementation deferred to a later PR (skip when implementing immediately).
- `Implemented` — merged; reconciled with what shipped.
- `Superseded by SPEC-XXX` — replaced; body kept, not deleted.

## Creating a SPEC

1. **Search first** (this index + a grep of `docs/specs/`). One SPEC per feature/capability — never two.
2. **Resolve ambiguity** — ask the user any material clarifying questions *before* writing (see `spec-workflow` §clarification gate).
3. `cp docs/specs/_template.md docs/specs/SPEC-NNN-<short-kebab-title>.md` where `NNN` is the next free number.
4. Fill it in. Acceptance criteria must be falsifiable and each map to a test. No `TBD`/placeholder in a load-bearing section before it leaves `Draft`.
5. If the change makes a load-bearing decision, also write/cite an ADR (`documentation-and-adrs`).
6. Add a row to the index above.
7. For a cross-cutting change, create/update the paired spec in the other repo, set `counterpart_spec` on both, and write a coordination doc.

## Updating a SPEC (the default for any existing feature)

Update the existing SPEC — never open a second — when improving/extending a feature, fixing a
bug that changes intended behavior, making a follow-up change, refactoring with a behavior change,
or correcting a wrong assumption. Append a Change Log entry every time.

## Exemptions (the only valid skips)

State the exact phrase, mirroring `tdd-workflow` waivers:

```
SPEC waived — non-code change.
SPEC waived — type-only.
SPEC waived — config change with no behavior impact.
```

"small change", "obvious fix", "trivial", "just a refactor" are NEVER valid skips.
